## Systems, Intelligence & the Stories We Tell

Welcome to my personal & technical blog, where I explore the evolving intersections of data, AI, high-performance computing, and human cognition.

Expect deep dives, hands-on experiments, and unconventional insights—from database internals and Apache Arrow to AI’s impact on how we think and create.

Some posts are about Go, emerging databases, and performance optimization. Others challenge how we interact with technology, how AI shapes thought, and where creativity meets engineering.

And sometimes, I just write poetry.

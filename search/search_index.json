These legacy approaches spend the majority of processing time converting and copying data rather than performing meaningful computation.</p> <p>Apache Arrow Flight is a high-performance RPC framework designed to eliminate these limitations.

Introduction","text":"<p>The challenge of data movement has become as critical as storage and compute. Organizations routinely generate and analyze terabytes of data. Transferring these large datasets between databases, analytics engines, and client applications is often a major bottleneck. Traditional client-server architectures were not designed for this scale. Interfaces such as ODBC (Open Database Connectivity) and JDBC (Java Database Connectivity), created decades ago, assume row-by-row data exchange. They were optimized for smaller datasets and lower bandwidth constraints. Likewise, many web APIs rely on JSON or CSV over REST for data delivery. While convenient, these formats introduce significant overhead due to parsing and data conversion inefficiencies.</p> <p>A key limitation in analytical workloads is the cost of serialization and deserialization. Before data can be used by a client, it must often be transformed from a database\u2019s internal format into an intermediate interchange format, such as rows for ODBC/JDBC or text for REST. The client then parses this data back into a usable structure. This process is highly inefficient. Studies have shown that serialization can account for up to 80\u201390% of total computation time in analytics pipelines. In practical terms, CPU cycles are wasted converting data between formats instead of performing meaningful analysis. For example, a columnar database serving data through JDBC must convert its column-oriented storage into row-oriented results for the JDBC driver. If the client requires columnar processing, these rows are converted back into columns, resulting in a double serialization penalty. This unnecessary processing can slow data movement by 60\u201390% in many scenarios.</p> <p>Another limitation of legacy data APIs is their single-stream, row-wise processing model. JDBC retrieves one row at a time or small batches from the database. This structure is inefficient for modern columnar data engines and analytics libraries, which benefit from vectorized operations and column-wise memory access. ODBC has some support for bulk columnar transfer, but it still requires copying data into the application\u2019s format when it does not align with the client\u2019s needs. Additionally, these APIs were designed for individual clients consuming query results. They do not natively support partitioning result sets or parallel retrieval by multiple workers. In an era dominated by distributed computing frameworks such as Spark and Flink, this single-stream model creates a scalability bottleneck. If a query returns a massive dataset, traditional protocols lack a standardized way to distribute the result across threads or nodes. The client must fetch everything sequentially from a single connection.</p> <p>Beyond ODBC and JDBC, many organizations expose data through RESTful APIs for ease of integration. However, transmitting large datasets as JSON or CSV over REST introduces excessive text serialization overhead. JSON inflates data size because numbers and binary data must be encoded as text. Parsing this text on the client side is computationally expensive. HTTP/1.1, without streaming support, forces chunked transfers or pagination, increasing latency and complexity. Even with compression, JSON-based REST pipelines cannot match the efficiency of binary protocols due to the CPU cost of encoding and decoding, as well as the lack of an optimized in-memory data format.</p> <p>Some databases attempt to bypass these inefficiencies with proprietary binary TCP protocols. While these solutions improve on ODBC and JDBC, developing and maintaining a custom protocol and client library for each system is labor-intensive. It also results in duplicated efforts across the industry. Even with these optimizations, most solutions still marshal data through row-based drivers, rarely achieving true zero-copy transfers.</p> <p>As data volumes scale, these inefficiencies compound, making row-oriented protocols and text-based serialization untenable. The need to minimize serialization overhead, exploit columnar processing, and handle large-scale transfers efficiently has become apparent. Apache Arrow, introduced in 2016, addressed part of this problem by providing a standardized in-memory columnar format. By using Arrow\u2019s format within an application, systems can eliminate costly conversions between different in-memory representations and improve cache efficiency. However, Arrow alone did not solve the transport problem. Data still had to be sent across processes and networks using legacy protocols, reintroducing the inefficiencies it sought to remove.</p> <p>Apache Arrow Flight was designed to eliminate these limitations. Flight is a high-performance RPC framework that allows large datasets to be exchanged between systems using the Arrow format itself. It drastically reduces serialization overhead by eliminating unnecessary transformations. The following sections examine how Arrow Flight works, how it compares to traditional data transfer mechanisms, and how it extends into SQL query integration.

These interfaces were instrumental in decoupling applications from specific database implementations, enabling developers to use a standardized API while relying on database-specific drivers.</p> <p>A typical ODBC or JDBC workflow involves an application submitting an SQL query. The database executes the query and returns the result set through the driver to the application. However, these interfaces were designed around row-based data transfer. A JDBC ResultSet, for example, delivers data row by row, requiring the client to iterate through the dataset sequentially. While some drivers internally fetch blocks of rows, they still deliver data in a row-oriented format. This presents a challenge when either the database or the client\u2014or both\u2014operate using a columnar format.</p> <p>Modern analytical databases such as Snowflake, Redshift, and DuckDB, along with dataframe libraries such as Pandas and R\u2019s data.table, are inherently column-oriented. When these systems interact via JDBC or ODBC, they must convert columnar storage into rows for transfer, only for the client to reconstruct them back into columns. This redundant transposition process can consume between 60 and 90 percent of total data transfer time.</p> <p>Beyond transposition costs, ODBC and JDBC are not optimized for extreme data volumes. They often require multiple layers of buffering and copying. A database engine typically copies query results into driver buffers, performing type conversions along the way. The driver then copies data again into application variables or objects. These redundant memory copies add both latency and CPU overhead. While some efforts, such as TurbODBC, attempt to mitigate these inefficiencies by fetching large batches of results directly into columnar Arrow arrays, they are still constrained by ODBC\u2019s abstractions.</p> <p>Another key limitation is that traditional ODBC and JDBC models establish a single result stream per query. These interfaces do not natively support partitioning query results or retrieving them in parallel across multiple workers. If a database is distributed, it must consolidate results into a single stream before sending them to the client. This bottleneck can severely impact performance, particularly in high-throughput analytics workflows.</p>"},{"location":"blog-posts/flight/#restful-apis","title":"RESTful APIs","text":"<p>With the rise of web applications and cloud platforms, many organizations have adopted REST APIs to expose data in formats such as JSON, XML, or CSV. These APIs provide platform-neutral access, making data retrieval possible with a simple HTTP request. However, they introduce significant inefficiencies when handling large datasets.</p> <p>JSON, for example, is a highly verbose format. Every value must be encoded as text, meaning that numerical and binary data require additional characters for encoding. The result is increased data size on the wire. Parsing JSON on the client side is equally expensive, often requiring more CPU cycles than the network transfer itself. Even optimized binary serialization formats, such as MessagePack and Protocol Buffers, require deserialization into in-memory objects, introducing overhead proportional to data size.</p> <p>REST APIs also struggle with large-scale streaming. While HTTP/1.1 supports chunked transfer encoding and HTTP/2 allows multiplexed streams, many REST clients must receive an entire response before processing. This limitation forces developers to implement pagination or chunked retrieval, adding round-trip latency and unnecessary complexity. By contrast, modern RPC frameworks such as gRPC allow for true streaming, where the server can push data incrementally as it is produced.</p> <p>Custom Protocols and TCP Sockets Given the limitations of generic data transfer interfaces, some systems implement proprietary client libraries or binary protocols for efficiency. Many cloud data warehouses provide native connectors that bypass ODBC and JDBC to deliver data with lower latency. Other platforms use middleware that serializes and transmits data as a pre-encoded binary stream.</p> <p>While these custom solutions can be efficient, they introduce new challenges. Developing and maintaining a custom network protocol requires significant effort, including implementing authentication, serialization, and error handling. Each new system effectively reinvents the wheel, leading to duplicated development work across the industry.</p> <p>More importantly, without a standard format, these custom protocols suffer from interoperability issues. A proprietary database might export data as a binary stream, but without a shared schema or format, the receiving system may be unable to interpret it without a custom adapter. This lack of standardization is one of the reasons ODBC and JDBC, despite their inefficiencies, have remained dominant.</p>"},{"location":"blog-posts/flight/#the-need-for-a-new-approach","title":"The Need for a New Approach","text":"<p>The inefficiencies of legacy data transfer protocols have made large-scale analytics more difficult than it should be.

When both the sender and receiver use Arrow, they can exchange data at near-zero cost, but an optimized protocol was needed to capitalize on this advantage. Flight extends Arrow\u2019s zero-copy philosophy to the network, allowing two processes to transmit Arrow data structures without first converting them to an intermediate format.

Comparing Flight with Traditional Data Transfer Mechanisms","text":"<p>How does Apache Arrow Flight stack up against legacy data access methods like JDBC/ODBC or REST? The following table summarizes key differences and highlights Flight\u2019s advantages:</p> Feature Apache Arrow Flight JDBC/ODBC REST APIs Data Format Columnar, Arrow-native: transfers data as Arrow record batches with no conversion overhead Row-oriented (tuple-based). Some support for array fetch (ODBC), but data is typically transposed into rows Text-based (JSON, CSV, XML). Some binary formats exist (Avro, ProtoBuf), but not columnar-focused Serialization Overhead Minimal/Zero-copy: No serialization/deserialization if both sides use Arrow Significant overhead: Data converted from database format \u2192 driver row format \u2192 application structures. Can consume 60\u201390% of transfer time High overhead: Text encoding/decoding is CPU-intensive and increases data size Throughput High-throughput streaming: Designed to saturate network bandwidth. Achieves 20+ Gb/s per core. Can leverage multiple streams in parallel for scalability Moderate: Limited by row-by-row processing and client-side parsing. Batching helps, but single-threaded fetch underutilizes modern networks Low to moderate: Text payloads and HTTP overhead limit throughput. Compression improves performance but adds CPU cost Latency for Large Results Low latency: Server pushes batches as soon as available. Clients process data before entire result is sent Higher latency: Clients fetch in chunks (e.g., 1000 rows per request). Blocking calls prevent true pipelining High latency for big data: Paginated HTTP requests add round-trip delays. JSON parsing stalls processing until complete Parallelism Built-in parallel streams: A single dataset can be split across threads/nodes. Clients can issue multiple DoGet calls with different tickets to retrieve partitions concurrently Limited: A single query result is retrieved via one connection. Applications can open multiple connections for different queries, but not for parallelizing one query\u2019s result Limited: Clients must manually partition data and issue multiple requests. Some APIs support parallel exports, but no general standard exists Concurrency Many clients and streams: Flight servers handle simultaneous high-throughput streams. gRPC uses HTTP/2 multiplexing to prevent head-of-line blocking Moderate: JDBC/ODBC drivers can handle multiple connections, but each is a separate OS socket. High concurrency is limited by the database\u2019s connection handling Moderate: REST servers scale with load balancers, but each request is handled sequentially. HTTP/2 multiplexing is possible, but rarely used in REST APIs Scalability Horizontal &amp; Vertical Scaling: Flight scales horizontally by distributing data across servers and vertically by using all CPU cores for parallel processing. No inherent throughput limit Limited horizontal scaling: JDBC/ODBC does not split query results across multiple nodes. Scaling requires manual sharding or federated queries Horizontal scaling possible via API gateways/load balancers, but each request is single-threaded in semantics. Large data is often handled through downloadable files Client-Side Data Handling Arrow-native: Clients receive Arrow data, which integrates natively with pandas, PySpark, R, and Arrow-based tools. No need for row-column conversion Row-oriented: Clients receive tuples (e.g., Java ResultSet). Converting to columnar structures adds significant overhead Heavy transformation required: Clients must parse JSON/XML into usable data structures, adding CPU and memory overhead Server-Side Integration Effort Lower implementation burden: Flight automates transport, serialization, and security, allowing developers to focus on hooking into Arrow arrays. No need to design a custom protocol High complexity: Each database must implement a custom JDBC/ODBC driver, mapping its internal data to standard types. Requires buffering, network handling, and query execution logic Varies: Basic REST APIs are easy to build, but for large data, chunking, streaming, and authentication must be implemented manually Client-Side Integration Effort Multi-language clients available: Flight clients exist for C++, Java, Python, Go, Rust, and more. Arrow libraries handle serialization automatically Moderate: JDBC is simple for Java, but Python/C++ must use bridges (JDBC-ODBC). Requires installing drivers for each database Easy for basic use: Any HTTP client can access REST APIs, but for high-performance scenarios, custom implementations for streaming and parsing are required Standardization Emerging standard: Flight is part of Apache Arrow and gaining traction. Flight SQL aims to provide a standardized SQL interface for Arrow-native databases Mature standard: Virtually every database supports JDBC/ODBC. However, no standardized columnar data transfer exists. Each driver is a proprietary implementation No universal standard: REST APIs vary widely; some use OData or GraphQL, but each has different capabilities Security &amp; Authentication Built-in TLS &amp; Auth: Flight supports TLS encryption and custom authentication (BasicAuth, OAuth, Kerberos, etc.) using gRPC interceptors Mature security features: ODBC/JDBC can use TLS, Kerberos, LDAP, but older drivers may lack modern security mechanisms HTTPS encryption available, but authentication varies per API. Each service implements its own token-based or OAuth authentication SQL Support Transport-only (without Flight SQL): Base Flight does not handle SQL queries, but Flight SQL extends it with full SQL support Full SQL support: JDBC/ODBC are designed for SQL-based interactions and include metadata, transactions, and prepared statements Varies: Some REST APIs expose SQL-like queries, but there is no standardized SQL grammar across services"},{"location":"blog-posts/flight/#vi-flight-sql-a-columnar-native-interface-for-sql-databases","title":"VI.
